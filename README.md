Sapphire-Ice simulates fluid dynamics and heat transfer in phase-changing water and ice systems.

We employ the [Sapphire](https://github.com/geo-fluid-dynamics/sapphire) engine for PDE-based simulations,
which in turn employs sophisticated open-source scientific software libraries, most importantly [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/).
